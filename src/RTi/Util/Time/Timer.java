/**
This class provides a way to track execution time similar to a stopwatch.
To use the class, declare an instance and then call "start" and "stop" as necessary to add to the time.
Use "clear" to reset the timer to zero.  The timer amounts are tracked internally in milliseconds.
Note that the timer process does introduce overhead into program execution because it requests the system time
and should only be used when debugging or in cases where the performance issues are not large.
For example, put start/stop calls outside of loops, or, if in loops, consider only using if wrapped in Message.isDebugOn() checks.
@deprecated Use StopWatch class.
