/**
This class dispatches a specific event on a defined time interval, as a separate thread.
This is useful for checking on the intermediate status of a task, like a query or external program execution.
One sleep cycle occurs before any event is generated.
The EventTimer should be used as follows:
<pre>
EventTimer et = new EventTimer ( 1000, SomeActionListener, "AnActionPerformedString" );
// Implement actionPerformed() and check getActionCommand() for
// "AnActionPerformdedString"

// When done:
et.finish();
</pre>

private Boolean		_isDone=Boolean.FALSE;
					// Indicates whether event generation
					// is done.  Need a Boolean to allow
					// synchronization.
private String		_event=null;	// Event string that is passed to listener.

/**
Create an event timer, which will generate an ActionEvent with a command
string of "s", generating an event every "ms" milliseconds.
@param ms Interval between generated events, milliseconds.
@param al ActionListener that receives the events.
@param s String command name.  Check the ActionEvent's getActionCommand() value against this.
