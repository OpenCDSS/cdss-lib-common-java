/**
SimpleJChoice copies the behavior of the AWT Choice object, using a JComboBox as its underlying class.
It is designed to make things easier for developers moving between AWT Choices and Swing JComboBoxes.  
The value for the SimpleJChoice's editable setting is always 'false' and cannot be changed.
If a JComboBox that can be edited is needed, see SimpleJComboBox.<p>
Notes on use:
<ol>
<li>	This class does not support handling multiple items with the same String value very well.
	
	Suppose a SimpleJChoice has two Strings "XYZ" in the 0th and 10th spots.
	These strings are not equivalent via '==', but are equivalent with .equals(). 
	If the user selects the second one, getSelectedIndex() will return 0 (for the first one), instead.<p>
	It's not intuitive behavior, and it may be a bug in the underlying
	JComboBox class, but that's how the class will perform.</li>
<li>	The method remove(String) will remove only the first occurrence of the given String,
	if more than one exists in the list.</li>
</ol>
@deprecated Should use SimpleJComboBox instead, as it has had far more development.
REVISIT (JTS - 2006-05-23) Remove this class!
