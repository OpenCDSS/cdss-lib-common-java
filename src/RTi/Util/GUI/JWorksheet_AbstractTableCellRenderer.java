/**
Base class from which other classes that are to be used as cell renderers in the JWorksheet should be built,
as it provides a getWidths() routine (which is used by JWorksheet) if the other classes do not.<p>
TODO (JTS - 2006-05-25)<p>
If I could do this over again, I would have combined AbstractTableCellRenderer,
DefaultTableCellRenderer and AbstractExcelCellRenderer into a single cell renderer.
The reasoning for having the separation came about from the way the JWorksheet was designed originally.<p>
AbstractTableCellRenderer was supposed to be The Base Class for all other renderers,
providing the basic outline of what they would do.<p>
DefaultTableCellRenderer was supposed to be used for worksheets that didn't require any special cell formatting.<p>
AbstractExcelCellRenderer was supposed to be the base class for cell renderers that would do formatting of cell contents.<p>
In theory.<p>
In practice, ALL cell renderers are doing cell formatting,
so the AbstractTableCellRenderer and DefaultTableCellRenderer are unnecessary overhead.
<p>
<b>Also</b><p>
I really don't see much of a good reason to even REQUIRE cell renderers for most classes.
There are a lot of cell renderers out there that are almost 100% the same class.
At this point there's little chance of going back and eliminating them, but if I could I would.
Use a default cell renderer for all those classes and eliminate a lot of maintenance woes.
