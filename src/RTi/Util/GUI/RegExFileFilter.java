/**
RegExFileFilter is a simple JFileChooser file filter that matches files based on Regular Expressions.

A RegExFileFilter contains a <b>single</b> filter for use in a dialog.
This single RegExFileFilter can match more than one regular expression.<p>

The description used in the various constructors should be concise.<p>

The following is an example in which a JFileChooser is set up with two RegExFileFilters:<p>
<pre>
JFileChooser fc = new JFileChooser();
fc.setDialogTitle("Choose data file to open");

RegExFileFilter cff = new RegExFileFilter("^A.*", "Filenames starting with 'A'");

Vector v = new Vector(2);
v.addElement(".*in.*");
v.addElement(".*out.*");
RegExFileFilter dff = new RegExFileFilter(v, "Filenames containing 'in' or 'out'");

fc.addChoosableFileFilter(cff);
fc.addChoosableFileFilter(dff);
fc.setFileFilter(dff);
</pre><p>

The code above will create a JFileChooser for opening data files of two specified kinds.
In the file dialog, the user can choose between opening:<br>
"Filenames starting with 'A'" or<br>
"Filenames containing 'in' or 'out'"<p>
The default file filter that will be selected when the JFileChooser appears on-screen will be dff,
or "Filenames containing 'in' or 'out'"<p>

The above are very simple examples, and are not meant to explain anything about regular expressions.
To learn more about regular expressions, search the web or see the Javadocs for java.lang.String.matches().<p>

Note that the developer can choose to have the description for a filter
show the regular expression that is used to match with (ie, the chooser could instead show:<br>
"Filenames starting with 'A' (^A.*)"<br>
but this could confuse users.
