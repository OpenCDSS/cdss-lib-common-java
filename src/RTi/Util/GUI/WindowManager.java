/**
The WindowManager class allows applications to more easily manage their windows.  This
class handles opening 2 kinds of windows:<br><ul>
<li>Windows where only instance can be opened at a time.  These are referred
to simply as Windows.</li>
<li>Windows where multiple instances can be opened at a time.  These are
referred to as Window Instances.</li>
</ul><p>

This base class should be extended to create a Window Manager for each
application.  The most basic extended Window Manager should at least 
implement the displayWindow() method and call the super class constructor with 
a parameter that is the number of windows to be managed.  The manager should
also declare integer values for referring to each window, for instance:
<blockquote><pre>
	public final int 
		WINDOW_MAIN =		0,
		WINDOW_OPTIONS = 	1,
		WINDOW_NEW_DATA = 	2;
</pre></blockquote><p>

<b>General Overview</b><p>

In the first case, 
a window of a particular type can only have one visible instance.
If the user opens a window and tries to open it again, the
WindowManager will move the already-open copy of the window to the front of
the screen and will not create a new copy of the window.  Until the user 
closes the
window, the WindowManager will continue to do this every time an attempt is made
to re-open the window.  This case will use any method named 
<b>XXXWindow()</b> (where XXX is the action performed by the method, such as
set or get).<p>

The second case works almost identically to the first, except that there can
be multiple instances of each window open.  Each instance of the window is
identified by a unique identifier (see below).  
If the application attempts to 
open another copy of the window with the same unique 
identifier, the already-open copy of the window with that identifier is 
displayed.  This case will use the methods named <b>XXXWindowInstance()</b>.
In addition, any variables that have the word 'instance' in their name are
only used with window instances.<p>

<b>Unique Identifier</b><p>
The unique identifier that is used to manage multiple instances of the same
window type is application-dependent and can be any Object, though the Object
must implement the <tt>boolean equals(Object)</tt>
method, which is used to compare identifiers.<p>

Note that the unique identifiers are used to identify different Window 
Instances, not Window types.  Window types are identified with integer values
that typically are named WINDOW_*, as defined in the derived window manager
class.  These integers are used as array indices and should therefore be
numbered sequentially, starting with 0 (see below).  
For example, to open a certain Window in
an application code like this might be used:<p>
<blockquote><pre>
	JFrame window = __windowManager.displayWindow(WINDOW_OPTIONS, false);
</pre></blockquote><p>
To open a certain instance of a particular window, the following code might
be used:<p>
<blockquote><pre>
	JFrame window = __windowManager.displayWindow(WINDOW_NEW_DATA, false,
		"ID: " + data.getID());
</blockquote></pre><p>

In the first example only a single instance of the window represented by 
WINDOW_OPTIONS can be open.  In the second example, multiple instances of the
window represented by WINDOW_NEW_DATA can be open, and in this case an instance
with the unique identifier '"ID: " + data.getID()' is being opened or displayed.
<p>

Unique identifiers are not required to be Strings.  They can be
any Object that implements the equals() method.  However, using simple objects
may improve performance and be more robust.<p>

<b>Initialize</b><p>
Apart from the method displayWindow() that must be extended when 
derived classes are built, 
derived classes must also call the initialize() method of the
super class.  The parameter passed to initialize is the number of window types
that will be managed by the WindowManager.  Here is some example Constructor 
code:<p>
<blockquote><pre>
protected final static int _NUM_WINDOWS = 12;
	public GenericWindowManager() {		
		super(_NUM_WINDOWS);
	}
</pre></blockquote><p>

<b>Window Instances</b><p>

By default, no window allows multple instances.  This must be turned on with
a call to setAllowMultipleWindowInstances(). Here some sample code:<p>
<blockquote><pre>
	__windowManager.setAllowMultipleWindowInstances(WINDOW_OPTIONS, true);
</blockquote></pre><p>
This turns on multiple instances for the Options window.  Otherwise, only a 
single options window could ever be open.<p>

<b>Internal Arrays</b><p>
This class manages several internal arrays (such as _windowStatus and 
_windows) that are sized by the initialize() method to the number of windows
passed in to that method (see above).  The index of each element in these
arrays corresponds to a particular window type.  These unique indices should
be specified in the derived class.  As an example:<p>
<blockquote><pre>
	public final int 
		WINDOW_MAIN =		0,
		WINDOW_OPTIONS = 	1,
		WINDOW_NEW_DATA = 	2;
</pre></blockquote><p>
In the above example, the window manager's constructor should call
super.initialize() with a parameter of 3, so that the window manager is set up
to manage 3 windows.  At this point, each of the above window types has a 
space set aside for it in the internal arrays.  Information in the arrays about
the main window is in array position 0, information about the options window
is in array position 1, and information about the new data window is in array
position 2.<p>

These window types are used to represent window regardless of whether the
window supports only a single instance being open or multiple instances being
open.  In fact, because of the way this class implements the window management
system, all the windows can be represented as both windows that allow a single
instance and windows that allow multiple instances, at the same time.<p>

An example of how this could be useful uses an imaginary application in 
which a window allows both entry of new data and editing of existing data.  It
is decided that only a single new entry window should be open at a time.  More
than one edit window for existing data can be open at a time.  When the window
for creating new data is created, the setWindow() methods are used.  When
the windows for editing existing data are created, the setWindowInstance() 
methods are used.  In this way, the same window identifier is used to refer
to both types of windows.  Since only a single Window can be open at a time,
using the window methods for new data reults in only a single new data window
ever able to be open.  Using the window instance methods allows multiple data
edit windows to be open.
<p>

The WINDOW_* are used in methods to refer to the window type upon which an 
operation should occur instead of referring to each window type by an integer
value.<p>

<b>displayWindow()</b><p>
The displayWindow() method must be overridden in order for derived
WindowManager classes to properly open windows.  Because this method will
vary greatly depending on the application in which the WindowManager is 
being used, the following is a step-by-step description of what should 
happen in this method:<p>

<b>1.</b> If the window does not allow multiple instances to be open, then 
do the following:<p>
<blockquote>
	<b>1.1.</b>If no copy of the window is already open
	create a new copy of the window and set it to be open.<p>
	<pre>
		if (getWindowStatus(winIndex) != STATUS_OPEN) {
			JFrame window = new WindowToBeCreated(...);
			setWindowOpen(windowIndex, window);
	</pre><p>
	<b>1.2.</b> Otherwise the window must already be open.
	If so, make sure it is not minimized and then pop the window to
	the front of all the windows.  Code similar to this can be used:<p>
	<pre>
		if (getWindowStatus(windowType) == STATUS_OPEN) {	
			win = getWindow(windowType);
			win.setState(win.NORMAL);
			win.toFront();
			return win;
		}
	</pre><p>
</blockquote>
<b>2.</b> Check to see if the window to be displayed allows multiple instances
to be displayed.<p>
<blockquote>
	<b>2.1.</b> If so, then get the unique identifier for the window 
	instance to display.  For example, 
	have the application generate it and then pass it 
	in to an overloaded version of the displayWindow method.<p>
	<b>2.2.</b> If no instance of the window with the identifier is
	already open then create a new one and call setInstanceOpen to
	set that instance of the window to be marked as open.  The following
	pseudo-code demonstrates this:<p>
	<pre>
		// id == unique instance identifier passed in to the
		// displayWindow call
		if (getWindowInstanceStatus(winIndex, id) != STATUS_OPEN) {
			JFrame window = new WindowToBeCreated(...);
			setWindowInstanceOpen(windowIndex, window, id);
	<pre><p>	
	<b>2.3.</b> Call getWindowInstanceStatus for the unique identifier
	and see if there is already a window instance with that identifier
	that is open.  If the window
	exists, make sure the window is not minimized and
	also pop it to the front.  Code similar to this can be used:<p>
	<pre>
		if (getWindowInstanceStatus(windowType, id) == STATUS_OPEN) {
			win = getWindowInstanceWindow(windowType, id);
			win.setState(win.NORMAL);
			win.toFront();
			return win;
		}
	</pre><p>
</blockquote><p>
Working with Windows and Window Instances should not be confusing, as the code
is practically the same.  The major differences are that method names differ
slightly (doSomethingToWindow() versus doSomethingToWindowInstance()) and
that Window Instance methods will require passing in the unique identifier in
order to locate the instance on which to operate.  <p>

<b>Closing Windows</b><p>
All the code for closing a window inside application JFrames must go
through the WindowManager, if the WindowManager is to manage those windows.
Do not dispose() of JFrames that are managed by the WindowManager -- let the
WindowManager close them instead.
This code will be fairly-JFrame specific, though it must finally call either
closeWindow(...) or closeWindowInstance(...), depending on the type of 
window it was opened as.  These methods will close the window.<p>

As an example, in a JFrame, the calls for closing the frame 
(from a Close button, an error in the frame, or pressing the X button) 
should result in a call being made to __windowManager.closeWindow(WINDOW_X); or
__windowManager.closeWindowInstance(WINDOW_X, id);.
Of course, the name of the Window Manager instance and the window type variable
will be different in actual code, but this is the general pattern.
