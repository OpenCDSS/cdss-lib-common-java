/**
Returns a component that is used for editing the data in the cell; from 
TableCellEditor.<p>
Its original javadocs:<br>
Sets an initial <code>value</code> for the editor. This will cause the editor 
to <code>stopEditing</code> and lose any partially edited value if the editor 
is editing when this method is called.<p>
Returns the component that should be added to the client's 
<code>Component</code> hierarchy. Once installed in the client's hierarchy 
this component will then be able to draw and receive user input.
@param table the JTable that is asking the editor to edit; can be null
@param value the value of the cell to be edited; it is up to the specific 
editor to interpret and draw the value. For example, if value is the string 
"true", it could be rendered as a string or it could be rendered as a check 
box that is checked. null is a valid value
@param isSelected true if the cell is to be rendered with highlighting
@param row the row of the cell being edited
@param column the visible column of the cell being edited
@return the component for editing
