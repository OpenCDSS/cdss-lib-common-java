/**
The EndianRandomAccessFile class is used to read and write little and big endian
values to/from a random access file.  The RandomAccessFile base class big endian
Java methods are available and "LittleEndian" versions are available in this
class for reading/writing little endian data.  Consequently, it is possible to
open a binary file and read/write little and big endian values for the same
file.  More often, a file will include data of one endian type.  For example,
temporary binary files written with a C, C++, or Fortran program on a little
endian machine will contain little endian values.  In this case, an
EndianRandomAccessFile can be constructed with match_system=true and then the
readEndian*() and writeEndian*() methods can be used.  If a binary file is known
to always contain only big-endian values, then a RandomAccessFile should be
used.  If a binary file is known to always contain only little endian values,
then a EndianRandomAccessFile should be used and the LittleEndian methods should
be called.
