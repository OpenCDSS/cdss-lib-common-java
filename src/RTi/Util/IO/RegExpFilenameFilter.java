/**
This class implements FilenameFilter for use with FileDialog.
It supports UNIX-style wildcards in filenames, as follows:
<p>
<pre>
.     Match one character.
*     Match zero or more characters.
[...] Match any one of the characters enclosed in the brackets.
      This can be a list of characters or a character range separated by a -.
</pre>
<p>
To use with FileDialog, contruct this filter with an appropriate filename regular expression
(usually *.ext, where ext is a desired file extension). Then specify the filter to the FileDialog.
