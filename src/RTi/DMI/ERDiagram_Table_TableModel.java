what kind of data type it is dealing with.  what we use it for is in the
cell renderer base class, so that we know if a cell should be right-justified
(numbers) or left-justified (strings and dates).

AML: steve decided that the 0th column (the one that holds the row number)
shouldn't have a column name, so that's what I've been doing on other tables.
But you can put "ROW #" or whatever you want in there.

If you ever try to change a table name on the fly (say you start displaying a 
table, then a user changes a setting and you want to change a column name
from one value to another), it's not as easy as simply returning a new value
in this method.  I know I've dealt with it before, and it's a pain in the butt. 
It's easier to just rebuild the table entirely ... but you only need to worry
about this if you ever need to do that.

AML:
you'll see that in all these methods that use a switch() statement to switch
between columns that I have a 'default:' tag.  Really, strictly-speaking,
this isn't completely necessary, since if you set the __columns variable 
correctly up top then the switch() will never be out of bounds ... but it's just a good idea ...

AML:
the widths are specified in terms of the number of characters that should
fit across in the field.  Here's how the table actually determines the real
size ... (in the following, W is the width you specify in the array)

1) it gets the font setting for the table header and writes out W "X" characters
to a string.  So a W of 6 would make "XXXXXX" ... it then sees how many pixels
in the header font it would take to fit this string.

2) it gets the font setting for the cell fonts and writes out W "X" characters
and sees how many pixels would be required to fit this string.

3) whichever one is LARGER, it pads it out with a few more pixels (about 10, I
think) and that's the width of the column in pixels
