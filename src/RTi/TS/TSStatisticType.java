/**
This class stores time series statistic types,
which are a value or values determined from the sample given by the time series data points.
Some statistics are general in nature and could be applied outside of time series.
Some are specific to time series (e.g., day of year that some condition occurs).
This enumeration only provides a list of potential statistic types.
Computation and management of results occurs in other classes.
Code that uses these statistics types should typically decide which statistics are supported.
