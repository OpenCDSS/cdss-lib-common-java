<p>
GRShape is the base class for all GR shape classes.
At some point, additional information like color may be added to this class but currently shapes only store geometry information.
Set/get methods are not implemented to keep objects small and to optimize performance.  Access the data directly.
</p>
<p>
GRShape represents common shapes for drawing and also can be used as geometry objects with
geographic information system (GIS) data.  For example, see the RTi.GIS.GeoView.GeoRecord class.
